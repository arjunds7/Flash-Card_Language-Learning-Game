# Flash-Card_Language-Learning-Game

As I am currently trying to learn German, I built this Flash Card game to teach myself.

Working:

* A deck of words are chosen from a dictionary
* The script displays a particular word, and if you know the meaning of the word click 'Ok' and that word will not be shown again.
* If you dont know the meaning, click 'No' which will show the English meaning of the word and this card go at the back of the deck.
* If you wait for 3 seconds, the meaning of the word will be shown.


* Enjoy Learning.
